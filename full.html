                    <p>Our lifestyles, alongside our ideas of what constitutes a life with meaning, continually shift with time. We buy lifestyle brands, we make lifestyle choices, we read lifestyle magazines. But we also strive to improve our health, connect with family and friends, form and become part of communities, express our ideas and desires, enjoy leisure activities and create hope for the future. While the clichéd Queensland lifestyle is one of sun, sand and sea, the reality is far more nuanced and diverse — just like our landscape and our population.</p>
                    <p><cite>Lifestyle: a sunshine state of mind</cite> takes the concept of lifestyle and the context of Queensland and draws them together to present an interactive, participatory exhibition that explores six universal elements of living — wellbeing, home, expression, play, community and hope — against a unique sunshine state backdrop. In the process, it hopes to challenge stereotypes, provoke thought and engagement and shape ideas and stories about what the future of Queensland lifestyle might hold.</p>

Lifestyle aims to open up debate, challenge stereotypes, explore the unspoken and acknowledge that our lives revolve around a diversity of perspectives. To help achieve this, a group of nine Lifestyle ambassadors has been selected. They collectively form a diverse set of voices, reflective of the many different lifestyles, cultures and values of the Queensland community. Each of these ambassadors has a strong connection to Queensland and has inspiring stories across a broad range of lifestyle topics.</p>

                <div class="bodyText">
                    <p>The concept of wellbeing is certainly familiar — we see it frequently in magazines and on social media, where it’s promoted by glowing Instagram stars and sleek wellness gurus. Today, we face an overwhelming array of choices about ways to live a healthy, happy life, from exercise and nutrition to mindfulness and meditation. But perhaps attaining true wellbeing comes from within, based on what fulfils us and helps us attain that elusive sense of balance and harmony, inside and out.</p>
                    <p>In this theme we explore wellbeing through the dizzying array of guises it’s taken on during the last century, all shaped by the forces of culture, commerce and science. This section offers a fascinating visual history of our shifting ideas about wellbeing: from old wives’ tales and home remedies, to miracle products and modern day super foods.</p>

                    <p>Home isn’t just where the heart is; home isn’t just a physical space. Home is a castle, a feeling, a sense of connection and belonging that lends meaning and purpose to our lives. It’s the people closest to us: our most intimate relationships, our families and friends, our most trusted confidantes, our inner circle.</p>
                    <p>Although home is the place where we celebrate major anniversaries and milestones, much of our lives unfold in the everyday. Home is a place where little things happen with the people who play the biggest roles in our lives.</p>
                    <p>In this theme the concept of home is unpacked through collection material from the Rawson Family Archives, home movies from State Library’s collection and contemporary memento boxes from our Program Ambassadors that embody the multiple meanings of home: a place or a person, a memory or a feeling, an object or a story.</p>

                <div class="bodyText">
                    <p>For as long as humans have existed, we’ve created. The stories of our history are often told through art, from rousing speeches or great paintings that mark significant moments in time, to recreations of the past in novels or films. All this creativity isn’t simply a means of self-expression, but a way of understanding the human spirit, of connecting to culture or exploring big ideas.</p>
                    <p>You don’t have to be an artist to express yourself — your creativity might lie in how you dress, how you cook, how you decorate your space, how you let yourself be inspired by others. For some, creativity and expression is a way of life.</p>
                    <p>In this theme we explore significant moments and collectives in Queensland’s recent history of visual arts. Together, these diverse artefacts illustrate how Queensland artists have found numerous ways to break new creative ground and find meaning in expression.

                    <p>We tend to think of the Australian lifestyle as one largely experienced outdoors, particularly when it comes to how we spend our leisure time. In Queensland, our landscape and climate reinforce our passion for outdoor play and our reputation as a nation of sporting enthusiasts.</p>
                    <p>Unsurprisingly, the ways we play are changing. By 2013, the average Australian was spending over a quarter of their weekly leisure hours online; by 2016, 80% of Australians owned a smartphone, with many checking it first thing in the morning. Whatever our future play looks like, we can’t underestimate its importance in creating social cohesion and self-fulfilment.</p>
                    <p>In this theme we discover the unique pleasures of Queensland leisure time by taking you on a tour of the state’s most beloved activities, whether it’s casual games and barbecues in the backyard, camping and caravan holidays or trips to festivals and theme parks.</p>

                    <p>Community is an essential part of how we live our lives. It fosters belonging and connection; it shapes our values and helps us find meaning and determine what’s important. Community is about accessibility, inclusivity and diversity; it leaves no one out and no one behind.</p>
                    <p>Being part of a community also contributes to our sense of identity and purpose. Communities can create positive change by collaborating to achieve a common goal; in times of crisis, community members rally, sharing knowledge and resources to overcome adversity and create hope.</p>
                    <p>In this theme we invite you to explore a series of digital stories inspired by community and share your personal world view through the creation of a Meaningful Mandala: an activity developed in collaboration with Access Arts. We also invite you to explore what our International community thinks about lifestyle through a selection of TED talks.</p>

                <div class="bodyText">
                    <p>The future is a nebulous place but that doesn’t stop us from spending time there, at least in our heads: time imagining, wondering or dreaming about what might be waiting just around the corner or light years away.</p>
                    <p>While the stereotypical Australian — and perhaps especially the stereotypical Queenslander — is laidback and carefree, the reality is rather different.. New research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicates that Australia is in the bottom third of OECD countries in terms of working long hours. In 2017, a Mission Australia survey revealed that for the first time, young Queenslanders had named mental health as their number one issue of concern.</p>
                    <p>Here we encourage you to reflect on and share your hopes — your hopes for yourselves, for your loved ones, for the world — so we can begin to transform them into reality and shape a better world for generations to come.</p>
